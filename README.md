# boost_regulator_MIC2288

Small boost regulator board designed for use on breadboards. Will supply a 12V, 150mA output from a 3v-9v input.

Please note that the "VOUT" LED should be omitted to achieve the maximum output current. If you only require around 100mA or less, it can be populated to indicate the output state.
